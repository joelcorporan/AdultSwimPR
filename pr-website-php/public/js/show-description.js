			{
				"title": "Season seven of Childrens Hospital premieres on Friday, January 22nd at 11pm E/P on Adult Swim",
				"description": "Big questions will be answered, including: What's it like to live in a world without tongue depressors? What's really inside of Chief's hump? Is Childrens Hospital actually based off of a sketch from a 1950's variety show? Which religion is the right one? The series culminates with a sneak peak of the never-before-seen, completely crowdfunded Childrens Hospital Movie. You won't want to miss a single second. Especially the 5,402nd second...that one is really great. <br> <br> The show's creative team is led by executive producers/writers Rob Corddry (Ballers, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart), Jonathan Stern (Burning Love, NTSF:SD:SUV::), and David Wain (Wet Hot American Summer, Role Models), and stars Lake Bell, Rob Corddry, Erinn Hayes, Rob Huebel, Ken Marino, Megan Mullally and Henry Winkler. <br> <br> Childrens Hospital is produced by Abominable Pictures, The Corddry Company and Studio 2.0, and is distributed by Warner Bros. Television. <br> <br> Childrens Hospital won the EmmyÂ® Award in the Outstanding Special Class: Short-Format, Live-Action Entertainment Program category in 2012 and 2013, definitively proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's literally the best show ever made."
